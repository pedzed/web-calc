# Tres Framework

*Note: This is heavily in development. Codebase is unstable and may change
at any time.*

Tres is a well organized, powerful and highly extensible MVC framework for the 
PHP programming language.

The MVC (Model-View-Control) pattern allows you to easily reuse your code, 
because of its separation of concerns. As a web developer you only have 
to write your models once and you will be able to easily copy your models from 
project to project. Other developers can easily change the views without 
having to know much about PHP, or have to dig into the code.


## Requirements
