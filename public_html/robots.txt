# The robots.txt file gives instructions about your site. It's useful for the 
# so-called web crawlers.
# 
# There are two important considerations when using robots.txt:
# - Crawlers can ignore robots.txt. Note that there are malware robots that 
#   scan all around the web for security vulnerabilities.
# - The robots.txt file is a publicly available file. Anyone can see what 
#   sections of your server you don't want robots to use. Don't try to use 
#   robots.txt to hide information.
